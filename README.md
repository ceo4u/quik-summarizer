📝 Quik-Summarizer
Quik-Summarizer is a lightweight web application that summarizes long YouTube videos or text into short, easy-to-read summaries.

It uses:

Python (main.py) for the backend with Flask

HTML (index.html) for the frontend interface

Transformers / Hugging Face models for generating summaries using AI

Just paste a YouTube URL or text, and it will return a short summary — helping you save time and understand content faster.
